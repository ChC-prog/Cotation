This script allows you to add in Adobe Illustrator:
    - a horizontal and / or vertical dimension to the selection of an objet or a group of objects.
    - or an aligned dimension to the direct selection of segment
         It allows to choose also (in particular via a real-time preview):
             - the scale
             - the position of the dimension (above, below, etc.)
             - the position of the reference of the quotation value for small objects
             - the symbol used
             - the color of the quotation
             - the length of the attachment lines
             - the unit
             - the size of the dimensions and all its components (value, symbol, attachment
               lines, dimension lines).
